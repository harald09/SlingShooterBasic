Here is the final "Sling Shooter" game. This game is about to rescue people out of the city. 
For this you have to shoot with the catapult to the respective jailhouses.If you hit -> the grid will disappear and the prisoners are free!

-> The catapult can be moved with the A and D button or with the left and right arrow keys. 
-> With the space bar you can shot projectiles.
 

The game ends if you are exempt all three prisoners but there is no victory confirmation.
Have fun playing!


*(Unfortunately not all commitments make a sense or named weird. But this repository is the repository that I've used from the beginning and I've tried a lot in the beginning.

In future commitments such names will no longer occur!)
